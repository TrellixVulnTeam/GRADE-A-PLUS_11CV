Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I'm afraid I've got a temperature . I feel terrible .
Why did you lie to me in the email ?
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
See you later .
it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
The service did not help the situation .
Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .
Yes , Mum .
Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .
