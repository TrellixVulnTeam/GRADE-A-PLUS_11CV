I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .|||I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?|||Sure , I ' d like to .
Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?|||Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .|||I don ' t know what kind of salad are you like ?
Why can't I have it back ?|||Because you're leaving before your lease is over .|||I ' m sorry , but I can ' t see it .
Come on , you are left behind !|||Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .|||I know . I am going to do some exercise every day .
No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .|||Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .|||Oh , no . It ' s a real relief . I have a look at it .
Is it far ?|||No . it's only five minutes walk . you can't miss it .|||It ' s so beautiful . I ' m so tired .
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .|||That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .|||OK . I will .
Now , what seems to be the trouble ?|||It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .|||I know , but you should do it . You should have a good rest .
Don't feel like it . I'm broke .|||Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?|||Let ' s see . . . . . . . . . . . .
Oh , do you really think so ?|||Of course , otherwise you'll just have to wait for hours .|||Thank you for your help . I ' m going to have to work in a bit .
